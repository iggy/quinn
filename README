Quinn is a network monitoring package with a django frontend. I've written 
about 20 lines of code so far, so don't expect much.



Features
---------
network discovery
snmp
different network views
 * rack by rack (needs configuration)
 * standard "cloud" map (should work with regular discovery)
 * by tag (i.e. all servers running http, all servers in branch office 2, etc.)
 * big screen/NOC view
 * by subnet
UPS/RPS control via snmp
ping/service monitoring
notifications
auth against active directory (hopefully groups too)
client/agent that can track more data (disk usage, mem usage, cpu usage, etc.)
Open services from the network view (i.e. open http in new tab)
Would be nice to have some way to track the logins and passwords that our 
	company uses for everything (i.e. licensing site logins, etc.)
License tracking


Maybes
--------
Backups
 * self service... each user selects what they want on their own systems, etc.
 * distributed storage (i.e. use desktops as storage, multiple copies, site aware)
 * backups between sites
 * disk and tapes supported
 * cross platform
 * sql/exchange/pgsql/mysql support
 * virus scan during backup option
 * de-duplication
 * full backups only, but that won't matter because of the de-dup
TODO list


INSTALL
----------
change SECRET_KEY in settings.py
setup locations
