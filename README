Quinn is a network monitoring package with a django frontend. I've written 
about 20 lines of code so far, so don't expect much.



Features
---------
network discovery
snmp
different network views
 * rack by rack (needs configuration)
 * standard "cloud" map (should work with regular discovery)
 * by tag (i.e. all servers running http, all servers in branch office 2, etc.)
 * big screen/NOC view
 * by subnet
UPS/RPS control via snmp
ping/service monitoring
notifications
auth against active directory (hopefully groups too)
client/agent that can track more data (disk usage, mem usage, cpu usage, etc.)
Open services from the network view (i.e. open http in new tab)


Maybes
--------
backups
 * self service... each user selects what they want on their own systems, etc.
 * distributed storage (i.e. use desktops as storage, multiple copies, site aware)
 * backups between sites
 * disk and tapes supported
 * cross platform
 * sql/exchange/pgsql/mysql support
 * virus scan during backup option


INSTALL
----------
change SECRET_KEY in settings.py
